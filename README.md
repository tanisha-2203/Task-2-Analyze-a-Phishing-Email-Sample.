#Used Online Header Analyzers (Googleâ€™s Message Header Analyzer)
1. Access the Email: Open the email you want to analyze in your email client (Gmail)
2. Locate the Email Header:
    Open the email.
    Click on the three vertical dots (More options) in the top right corner of the email.
    Select "Show original." This will open a new tab with the full email header and the original message.
3. Analyse email header: Once you have the email header, you will see a lot of technical information. Key components to look for are:
     Check the "From" field to see the sender's email address.
     Return-Path
     Received
     SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Look for lines indicating SPF results. If it says "fail," it means the email was not sent from an authorized server.
     DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Check for DKIM signatures. If it says "pass," the email is likely legitimate. If it says "fail," it may be spoofed.
     DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance): Look for DMARC results. A "pass" indicates that the email aligns with the sender's domain policies.
4. Use Online Header Analyzers
